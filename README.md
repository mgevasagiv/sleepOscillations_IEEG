# sleepOscillations_IEEG (Drs. Maya Geva-Sagiv and Shdema Epstein)
See doc files for detailed documentation of slow-wave and spindle detection methods in iEEG data (recorded from epileptic patients).
All detection methods are found in SpindleDetector.m and SlowWaveDetector.m.

See useExample_SpindleDetector_public.m for an example of how to utilize this toolbox. 
Program requirements: Matlab (analyses were done in R2018a)

Interictal spike detections are required to run the ripple detector - see IED detector under - https://github.com/mgevasagiv/epilepticActivity_IEEG

Batch run version is available too - see AnalyzeSleepOsc.m under - https://github.com/mgevasagiv/rippleDetection_IEEG
